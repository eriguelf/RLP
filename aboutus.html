    <h1>About the Team</h1>
    <h2>Periodontist:</h2>
    <p1> Morris Wong was born and raised in Palmerston North, and graduated with a BSc from
Massey University in 1985. Following a post-graduate Diploma, he entered the School
of Dentistry at Otago University, where he completed a BDS in 1990. His first year
working was as Dental House Surgeon at Napier Hospital followed by locum dental
positions in Private dental practice.
<br>
<br>
In 1992 Morris travelled to Hong Kong, primarily to study language and to experience
the Chinese culture. What started as a 6-month visit eventuated into a 7 year stay,
where Morris worked in a private medical clinic as well as completing his Masters in
Periodontology. Towards the end of this period Morris headed a dental team as part of
a 10-week medical project in the North West of China.
<br>
<br>
Morris returned to New Zealand in 2000 and gained his specialist registration as a
Periodontist. The next 15 years were spent working in a group practice in Wellington
specialising in Periodontics and Dental Implants, and building up the Lower Hutt
practice. Currently Morris is working full time in Lower Hutt, and serves as visiting
Periodontist to Hutt Hospital, where he works primarily with the combined Cleft Lip and
Palate team.
<br>
<br>
Morris practices all aspects of periodontics and dental implants, and is a member of the
New Zealand Dental Association, New Zealand Society of Periodontology, Australia New
Zealand Academy of Periodontology, Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons,
American Academy of Periodontology, and the International Team for Implantology.
Spare time is usually spent with family, involvement in the Anglican Chinese Church and
writing periodontal reports. Current interests are skiing, snow boarding, tramping,
running, basketball, and music. Morris is married, and has 3 children aged 16, 14 and 11.
