    <h2>Periodontal Services and Procedures:</h2>

    
    <h2>Periodontitis: What is periodontal disease?</h2>
    <p1> Gum disease or periodontal disease is a bacterial infection caused by accumulation of
dental plaque on the teeth. It is a disease that affects the gums and supporting bone
surrounding the teeth. While periodontal disease does not cause pain it can lead to the
deterioration of the supporting bone around teeth and allow teeth to become loose. The
gums may become red, swollen and bleed easily, there may be a bad taste or smell from
the gums.
<br>
<br>
Pain is occasionally a problem if a periodontal abscess has formed around the root of a
tooth.
<br>
<br>
Periodontal disease is best treated under local anaesthetic by a periodontal surgeon. Your
surgeon will endeavour to remove the cause of the problem by removing the plaque and
bacteria from under your gums.
It is essential for this treatment to be successful that you continue to have your teeth
debrided of plaque and bacteria at regular intervals following the initial treatment.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Dental Implants: What is a dental implant?</h2>
<p1>
  Dental implants are used to restore the space left by missing teeth. They are a titanium
  replacement for the tooth root and they can support either a single tooth crown or
  sometimes 2 teeth bridge made by your dentist or prosthodontist.
  Dental implants can also be used to support a denture giving a very firm support to the
  denture and stopping any movement when eating or speaking. This can be provided with
  a single implant or more than one implant dependant on individual circumstance and
  preference.
<br>
<br>
They are placed with a surgical procedure, usually under local anaesthetic, however we
can offer sedation in some cases.
<br>
<br>
There is occasionally the need to improve the bone where an implant is to be placed and
this can be done with bone grafting. Sometimes this can be done at the time of placing the
dental implant and sometimes it is necessary to do this as a separate procedure. Each case
will be individually assessed and you will have opportunity to discuss this with your
Periodontist before you begin treatment.
<br>
<br>
Dentistry in NZ commonly uses a synthetic bone, your own bone or a mixture of the two.
If this is something that applies in your case your Periodontist will explain your options
to you.
</p1>
<h2>What is gingival grafting?</h2>
<p1>There are many causes of recession of the gums.
Gingival grafting is the procedure to move gum tissue from once site to another in the
mouth, most commonly to improve appearance if significant recession has occurred.
Gingival grafting is not always possible and careful consultation with a Periodontist is
necessary to discuss the treatment options and outcomes. A Periodontist will be able to
give you a realistic expectation of the outcome before your make a decision regarding
this treatment or if this treatment will give the best result for your personal case.</p1>

<h2>What is a frenectomy?</h2>
<p1>The band of tissue lying between the upper front teeth known as the ‘frenum’.
You will find the frenum connecting the inside of the upper lip to the gum tissue between
the roots of the upper front teeth or similarly between the centre of the inside of your
lower lip and the centre of your lower gums. Normally the frenum blends into the gum

tissue well above the level of the teeth. The procedure used to remove this tissue is
known as a “frenectomy.”
Frenectomy is used when there is a need to allow the lip more movement or if the frenum
is causing an unwanted gap between the front teeth.
Similarly, this can be done with the lower lip for the same reasons.</p1>

<h2>What is crown Lengthening?</h2>
<p1>Crown lengthening is a procedure used to take away bone and supporting tissue
surrounding a tooth. This done to give a better aesthetic to front teeth and occasionally
for functional reasons with molar teeth.
After taking away a little bit of bone from around the tooth the gums with be placed back
and moved into a new position so that more of the tooth can be seen and create a new
lower “gum line”.</p1>

<h2>What is Periocision?</h2>
<p1>Periocision is a procedure done after orthodontic treatment. The periodontist will
removed some of the ligament connecting the tooth to the surrounding bone. This allows
the tooth to settle into the position achieved through orthodontic treatment, and not return
to the original position. This will help to maintain ‘straight’ teeth long after orthodontic
treatment is completed.</p1>

<h2>What is tooth/canine exposure?</h2>
<p1>During the period where baby teeth are lost and adult teeth grown into place, occasionally
a tooth will grow a little off course. This is most common with the canine teeth and often
they need some help to come through. They are often high up behind the lip or lay across
the palate. The periodontist will removed the gum and bone blocking the tooth from
emerging in the right place and return the patient to the orthodontist to complete the
movement of the tooth.</p1>

<h2>What is a biopsy?</h2>
<p1>Biopsy is needed when some form of pathology is found in the mouth and we must
identify what this is. In common terms you may have a suspicious lump, cyst or sore. A
periodontist will remove a small part of this and send it to a lab for testing. The lab will
return a report with their findings and allow the periodontist to give diagnosis and the
best advice of treatment for the problem.</p1>
